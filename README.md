# InstacartClustering

## Description
This is a customer segmentation project. In this project the customers of Instacart Company were 
segmented in 5 groups using **K-Means Clustering Algorithm**. I also used **RFM analysis (Recency,
Frequency, Monetary)** to evaluate the clustering algorithm over theses metrics and to find the relative 
importance of each group and to create solutions to improve the company revenue based on each clusterâ€™s behavior.

Applied all data science steps, including data cleaning, exploratory
data analysis, data preparation, creation of a machine learning model
and performance analysis (Silhouette score and Distortion).

### Dataset
The dataset used contains a sample from the original dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data.

### Filling Null values
The variable **days_since_prior_order** had it's null values filled with 0, because we assumed that if it's null it's due to 
the fact that it's the first purchase of the customer.

### How RFM metrics were obtained ?

RFM stands for Recency, Frequency and Monetary, as the dataset does not contain products prices, neither the date of each purchase,
we had to make some assumptions.

**Recency** - it was derived from the mean of the gap between the purchases already done by each customer.

**Frequency** - it was derived from the quantity of orders.

**Monetary** - it was derived from the amount of products bought by each customer.
